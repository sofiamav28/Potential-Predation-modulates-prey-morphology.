# Potential-Predation-modulates-prey-morphology.

# Islands vs Mainland Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing predation pressure on different species across islands and continents. The analysis includes generating plots and performing statistical tests.

## Data

Place your CSV files in the `data` directory. The required files are:
- `asap.csv`
- `data_tot.csv`

## Scripts

- `analysis.R`: Main script for data analysis and visualization.

## Plots

The generated plots will be saved in the `plots` directory.

## Setup

1. Install the necessary packages:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("tidyverse", "dplyr", "data.table", "plyr", "ggplot2", "nortest", "hrbrthemes", "viridis", "ggbeeswarm", "devtools", "Rmisc", "remotes", "see", "showtext"))
    devtools::install_github("kassambara/easyGgplot2")
    devtools::install_github("psyteachr/introdataviz")
    ```
   
   Ensure compatibility with specific package versions needed for your project.

2. Set your working directory to the project folder:
    ```R
    setwd("path/to/project")
    ```

3. Run the analysis script:
    ```R
    source("scripts/analysis.R")
    ```

# PPP and Morphology Raster Mapping

This section of the project involves mapping species richness (ppp) and morphological variables across geographic locations using raster maps. Due to compatibility issues with the current version of R, specific spatial analysis packages (MapTools, rgdal, rgeos) are not available directly from CRAN. However, you can obtain formerly available versions from the CRAN archive:

- [MapTools](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/maptools/)
- [rgdal](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rgdal/)
- [rgeos](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rgeos/)

To install a specific version from the archive, use commands like:
```R
install.packages("rgdal", repos = "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rgdal/", type = "source")
 ```

# LMMs Fitting

This section describes the procedure for fitting Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) to analyze the influence of potential predation on prey morphology. The analysis involves several steps:

##Data Preparation
1. Load the necessary libraries:
 ```R
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)
 ```
2. Load your data:
 ```R
data <- read.csv("data/your_data.csv")
 ```

3. Prepare the data for LMM fitting: This may involve cleaning the data, transforming variables, or creating interaction terms as required for your specific analysis.

##Model Fitting

1. Fit a Linear Mixed Model:
 ```R
model <- lmer(morphology ~ predation_pressure + (1 | group_variable), data = data)
 ```
- morphology: Dependent variable representing prey morphology.
- predation_pressure: Fixed effect representing the level of predation pressure.
- group_variable: Random effect representing group-level variability (e.g., species, site).

2. Check model summary:
 ```R
summary(model)
 ```
3. Diagnostic Plots: Generate diagnostic plots to check model assumptions:
 ```R
plot(model)
 ```
##Interpretation and Reporting
Interpret the results: Assess the coefficients of the fixed effects and the variance components of the random effects to understand the impact of predation pressure on prey morphology.

Report findings: Document your findings in the report, including the model parameters, significance levels, and any relevant plots.

Note: Adjust the model specifications according to your research questions and data characteristics. For advanced model diagnostics or alternative specifications, consult the lme4 package documentation.
